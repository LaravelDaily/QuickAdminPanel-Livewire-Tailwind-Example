# Laravel + Livewire + Tailwind: Example AdminPanel

This is a demo-project, fully generated by [QuickAdminPanel.com](https://quickadminpanel.com) without writing a single line of code.

In addition to roles/permissions manager, there are a few example CRUDs (Contact Management and Transactions)

For the design, we're using [Notus JS theme](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/notus-js) from Creative Tim.
